Crystal Yee
Weather App

I used OpenWeatherMap's API in this lab. Initially I had a problem with Safari not working, although I gave my browser location access, 
somehow or another my system preferences blocked location access even though I explicitly gave my browser permission. Interestingly enough 
Firefox and Chrome didn't have the same problem. 

Besides that I just had to research how to do a cross-domain ajax get request. Thank you Stack Overflow. 
After that the lab was almost the same as lab 1, except that some data was stored in interesting ways such as Kelvin for temperature.
