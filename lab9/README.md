To install the desktop app run >> node install.js
go to the build folder and select the desired version

Otherwise you can run >> node tweetServer.js directly

In this lab I used nw-builder to create a desktop app using node.
Getting the app to run my server correctly was challenging. I got a 
really weird error where my html file would contiuously reload.
