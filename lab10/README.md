To install the desktop app run >> node install.js
go to the build folder and select the desired version

Otherwise you can run >> node tweetServer.js directly

In this lab I used chart.js to show how common a tag is, 
how many followers the tweeter has and what language is used.
On the visualize page, the graphs load automatically from the database.
If you load more tweets into the database using the load button, 
the graphs will update as tweets are retrieved in real time.
