A lot of the work in this lab was fixing errors I made in lab 5 where I had a server running and it could communicate with my app, but the server wasn't actually serving the app itself. 

I used Angular to print out progress messages after completing an action or receiving a message from the server. It outputs the total amount of tweets received at any time which makes it easy to identify when a query simply isn't finding any tweets.
